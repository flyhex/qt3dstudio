     *	We use the hashing algorithm called "sdbm".
     *
     *	This algorithm was created from sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation
     *	of ndbm) database library. It was found to do well in scrambling bits,
     *	causing better distribution of the keys and fewer splits. it also happens
     *	to be a good general hashing function with good distribution. the actual
     *	function is hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i]; what is included below
     *	is the faster version used in gawk. [there is even a faster, duff-device
     *	version] the magic constant 65599 was picked out of thin air while
     *	experimenting with different constants, and turns out to be a prime. this
     *	is one of the algorithms used in berkeley db (see sleepycat) and elsewhere.

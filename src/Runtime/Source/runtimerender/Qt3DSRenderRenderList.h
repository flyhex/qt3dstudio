     * The render list exists so that dependencies of the main render target can render themselves
     * completely before the main render target renders.  From Maxwell GPU's on, we have a tiled
     * architecture.  This tiling mechanism is sensitive to switching the render target, so we would
     * really like to render completely to a single render target and then switch.  With our layered
     * render architecture, this is not very feasible unless dependencies render themselves before
     * the
     * main set of layers render themselves.  Furthermore it benefits the overall software
     * architecture
     * to have a distinct split between the prepare for render step and the render step and using
     * this
     * render list allows us to avoid some level of repeated tree traversal at the cost of some
     * minimal
     * per frame allocation.  The rules for using the render list are that you need to add yourself
     * before
     * your dependencies do; the list is iterated in reverse during RunRenderTasks.  So a layer adds
     * itself
     * (if it is going to render offscreen) before it runs through its renderable list to prepare
     * each object
     * because it is during the renderable prepare traversale that subpresentations will get added
     * by
     * the offscreen render manager.

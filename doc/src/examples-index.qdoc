Included in Qt 3D Studio you will find a set of examples. These are located in the \c {examples}
folder in the installation folder.

\section1 Instructions

To compile the examples or other Qml or C++ applications you also need to install Qt in addition
to Qt 3D Studio. Binaries provided by Qt 3D Studio installer are compiled with Qt 5.10.1
and MSVC2015_64bit (win), clang_64 (macOS) and gcc 64bit (linux). For other combinations you need
to compile Qt 3D Studio yourself from sources. In that case, refer to the \e{build_instructions}
document available in the source code repository.

Extra setup steps after installing Qt 3D Studio and Qt 5.10.1:

\list 1
  \li Copy \c{<Qt 3D Studio installation directory>\Tools\Qt3DStudio\qml\QtStudio3D} under
   \c{<Qt installation directory>\5.10.1\<compiler>\qml} (e.g. \c{C:\Qt\5.10.1\msvc2015_64\qml}).
  \li Open the application's \c{.pro} file in Qt Creator.
  \li Add \c{<Qt 3D Studio installation directory>\Tools\Qt3DStudio\bin} to the end of the PATH
  variable in the \e{Run Environment} for the build.
   See \l{http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-build-settings.html#using-environment-variables}
   for details on how to set environment variables.
\endlist

The last three steps are only needed for C++ applications:
\list 4
  \li Copy \c{<Qt 3D Studio installation directory>\Tools\Qt3DStudio\include\QtStudio3D} under
  \c{<Qt installation directory>\5.10.1\<compiler>\include}
  (e.g. \c{C:\Qt\5.10.1\msvc2015_64\include}).
  \li Copy \c{qt_lib_studio3d.pri} and \c{qt_lib_studio3d_private.pri} from
  \c{<Qt 3D Studio installation directory>\Tools\Qt3DStudio\mkspecs\modules} to
  \c{<Qt installation directory>\5.10.1\<compiler>\mkspecs\modules}
  (e.g. \c{C:\Qt\5.10.1\msvc2015_64\mkspecs\modules}).
  \li Open the application's \c{.pro} file in Qt Creator and add
  \c{LIBS += -L<Qt 3D Studio installation directory>/Tools/Qt3DStudio/lib Qt5Studio3D$$qtPlatformTargetSuffix()}
  to your applicationâ€™s \c{.pro} file.
\endlist

\section1 QML Examples

\list
     \li \l {Qt 3D Studio: Dynamic Keyframes Example}
     \li \l {Qt 3D Studio: QML Streamer Example}
     \li \l {Qt 3D Studio: QML DataInput Example}
\endlist

\section1 More Examples

You can find more examples from \l {https://git.qt.io/public-demos/qt3dstudio}
, these examples are more visually appealing and suitable to use as for example demos.

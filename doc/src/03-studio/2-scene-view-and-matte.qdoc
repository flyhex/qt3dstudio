\title Studio: Scene View and Matte
\page studio-scene-view-and-matte.html
\ingroup qt3dstudio-studio

\image Studio-SceneView.png

The \e {scene view} is the center region of Studio, showing you the
visual result of rendering and compositing the layers of your
presentation, and also allowing you to select and transform elements
graphically.

Surrounding the scene view is the \e matte. The matte may not be
visible if your presentation is larger than the available space.

\section1 Scene View

The content of the scene view depends on whether or not you are using an
\l{studio-toolbar.html#edit-cameras}{edit camera}. Normally (without an
edit camera) the contents of all layers seen through the camera are composited in the scene view.
When an edit camera is used, the contents of the selected layer are seen as viewed through the edit
camera.

\section2 Selecting Elements

In addition to displaying content, the scene view allows you to select
and transform visible elements. Click on an element in the scene to
select it in the \l{studio-timeline-palette.html}{Timeline palette}
and show its properties in the
\l{studio-inspector-palette.html}{Inspector palette}.

Clicking in empty space will drop the current selection. Alternatively, you can click on empty
space in the \l{studio-slide-palette.html}{Slide palette} or on the matte to drop the
current selection.

\section2 Showing and Hiding Bounding Boxes

When an element is selected its bounding box is drawn in the scene view,
along with the bounding boxes of immediate children. If this is getting
in your way, you can turn off bounding boxes in the View menu.

\section2 Transforming Elements

When an element is selected, an interactive transform manipulator will
be displayed in the scene view. Click and drag on portions of the
manipulator to move/rotate/scale the element. (The manipulator displayed
is controlled by the current
\l{studio-toolbar.html#manipulator-modes}{manipulator mode}).

Alternatively, you can click and drag on the element itself to affect
the transform:

In \b{Position} mode:
\list
\li
  left-mouse dragging on the element will adjust the position
  perpendicular to the camera's view axis. (For example, if you drag an item to the left,
  it will move to the left.)
\li
  right-mouse dragging up/down on the element will move it farther
  from/closer to the camera.
\endlist

In \b{Rotation} mode:
\list
\li
  left-mouse dragging on the element will tumble it.
\li
  right-mouse dragging up/down on the element will rotate it counter
  clockwise/clockwise within the view.
\endlist

In \b{Scale} mode:
\list
\li
  left-mouse dragging up/down on the element will proportionately scale
  it smaller/larger.
\li
  right-mouse dragging up/down on the element will affect the local Z
  scale.
\endlist

\section1 Matte

Clicking the matte will deselect all selected objects in the presentation.

\title Using Variant Tags
\page using-variant-tags.html

The variant tags feature in 3D Studio enables excluding parts of a presentation during loading.
With variant tags you can avoid parsing and loading objects that are not needed in the presentation
for certain variants, saving on loading time and resource usage.

This makes it possible to create multiple variations of a product UI with one single Qt 3D Studio
presentation.

This page explains how to define and use variant tags in the editor. The variant tags will then
be loaded from the QML application.

\section1 Create Variant Groups and Tags

Variant filtering is done on layer level, to add a variant group and tags to that group,
select a layer in the scene graph and follow the steps below:

\list 1
  \li In the inspector palette, press \uicontrol {+ Group} in the Variant Tags section.
  \li Enter a group name, and press \uicontrol {Ok}.
      \note Group names must be unique to the project.
\endlist

Once you have created a variant group, you can create variant tags under it. To do so,
follow the steps below:

\list 1
  \li In the inspector palette, press the \uicontrol {+ Tag} next to the variant group name.
  \li Enter a tag name, and press \uicontrol {Ok}.
      \note Tag names must be unique to the variant group.
\endlist

\section1 Using Variant Tags

To use a variant tag on a layer, follow the steps below:

\list 1
  \li In the scene graph, select desired layer
  \li In the inspector palette, under the variant tag section, click desired variant tags to use
  them on the layer.
\endlist

Once you have assigned variant tags to a layer, it is indicated in the scene graph which layers
are using tags from which variant groups.

You can delete a variant tag or group by right-clicking the name of it in the inspector palette and
select \uicontrol {Delete Tag/Group}.

\section1 Importing and Exporting Variant Groups

You can import and export variant groups. Exporting will export all variant groups and tags to a
\c {.variants} file, default location for the export file is the project's \e presentation folder.

\section2 Export Variant Groups

To export variant groups, select the \uicontrol {Export} button in the variant tags section
in the inspector palette. Next, browse to the desired location, enter a file name,
and press \uicontrol {Save}.

\section2 Import Variant Groups

To import variant groups, select the \uicontrol {Import} button in the variant tags section

\uicontrol{Ok}.

When importing variant tags, imported tags will be merged with already existing tags.

\section1 Previewing with Variant Filtering

You can filter content by variant tags when previewing your presentation in the Viewer.
To do this, open the \uicontrol {Filter Variant} panel by clicking
\inlineimage variant-tags-icon.png
in the toolbar or by pressing the \c F7 key.

In this panel, you can select the variant filtering tags you wish to render when previewing in the
Viewer. Only the layers satisfying the selection will be rendered.

Variant filtering works the following way:

\list
  \li
    With no tags selected, all layers will render.
  \li
    With tags selected in one variant group, criteria for a layer to be rendered is that is should
    have one of the selected tags or no tag in the selected group.
  \li
    With tags selected in more than one variant group, the layers will need to fulfill criteria
    for each of the variant groups to be rendered.
\endlist

If any tags are selected, it is indicated by the appearance of the play button

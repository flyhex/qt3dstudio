1. Scope

This document contains the instructions to build Qt3D Studio


2. What You Need

Clone the 3D Studio repository from

https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/admin/projects/qt3dstudio/qt3dstudio

Additionally Qt 3D Studio Editor requires Boost library and optionally, if FBX assets
are used, also the FBX SDK.

2.1 List of tested 3rd party libraries and versions

    Boost                                   1.65.0
    FBX SDK                                 2016.1.2


3. Environment setup

3.1 Windows 10

You need Windows build tools. Download tools from
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126 .

Do a custom installation and select ATL/MFC SDK. For debugging the Qt 3D Studio,
you need to select also Windows SDK.

Download precompiled boost binaries from www.boost.org and extract them to:
<path to repo root>/src/3rdparty/boost/1.65.0

Download the Windows version installer of FBX SDK 2016.1.2 from link:
http://download.autodesk.com/us/fbx_release_older/2016.1.2/fbx20161_2_fbxsdk_vs2015_win.exe
Install the SDK and set FBXSDK environment variable to point to
<installation directory>/Autodesk/FBX SDK/2016.1.2.
Or copy the folder to <path to repo root>/src/3rdparty/FBX

3.2 macOS

Boost can be installed on macOS with HomeBrew package manager.
To install Homebrew run following command line in terminal:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
And then use the following to install boost:
brew install boost

Download the macOS version of FBX SDK 2016.1.2 from link:
http://download.autodesk.com/us/fbx_release_older/2016.1.2/fbx20161_2_fbxsdk_clang_mac.pkg.tgz
Install the SDK. By default <installation directory> on macOS is /Applications. Set FBXSDK
environment variable point to <installation directory>/Autodesk/FBX SDK/2016.1.2.
Or copy the folder to <path to repo root>/src/3rdparty/FBX

3.3 Linux

4. Setup project in Qt Creator

Open <path to repo root>\qt3dstudio.pro in Qt Creator.

Go to "Projects" view. Select desired Build & Run configuration (either
Release, or Debug). Tested configurations:

    Windows 10: Qt 5.9.0 MSVC2015_64bit
    macOS:  Qt 5.9.0 clang_64
    Linux:  TBDL

Under "Build steps" click "Add Build Step" and select "Make". To make
arguments type "install". This will move the qmlviewer plugin to correct
place under Qt.


5. Running Qt3DStudio

Run subproject Q3DStudio under Authoring

Quick Viewer example: Open <path to ndd
repo>\examples\qmldynamickeyframes\qmldynamickeyframes.pro in Qt Creator and
build it. Done!
